on any object in the community, such as articles, white papers,
press releases or pictures.</p><p>Comments are not limited to text, but can include attachments

<h2 class="sect2"><a name="requirements-application-overview" id="requirements-application-overview">1.1.3. Application
Overview</a></h2><p>General Comments is an application package that relies on the
ACS Messaging package. Comments can be associated with any object
in ACS 4.0, which gives you the benefits of the Permission System.
Comments are stored as ACS Messages.</p><p>When a user creates a comment, General Comments stores the
comment as an ACS Message and associates the comment to the object
commented on. The value set by the adminstrator on whether comments
go live immediately or needs approval first is stored along with
the comment during this phase. After this, the user is presented
with a page that displays contents of the comment along with
revision history, attachments, and links to perform actions on the
comment such as adding attachments or editing the comment.</p>

adding comments to objects in the system, and editing their own
comments later on.</p><p><span class="phrase">A user adding a comment:</span></p><p>Nurse Nancy is browsing through an ACS 4.0 site that has a page
for medical emergencies. Upon reaching the bottom of the page,
Nancy sees a posting that reads, "<i class="emphasis">Please help,
my child has just swallowed some cleaning solution!!!</i>". Nancy
sees that this posting was made only 30 seconds ago and quickly
posts a remedy for this situation. After she makes her posting, she
immediately revisits the page and happily sees that her posting is
already available.</p><p><span class="phrase">A user editing an old comment:</span></p><p>George Genius is reviewing all of the comments he has posted
over the last 24 hours. In one of his postings, George notices that
his mathematical formula for earthquake prediction was incorrect.
He then clicks on the edit link, makes changes to his formula and
submits his changes. Since comments are moderated, others will only
see his older incorrect version until his changes are approved.
George eagerly awaits for his changes to be approved so that he
won't be ridiculed by his colleagues for his mistakes.</p><p><span class="phrase">An adminstrator moderating:</span></p><p>Adam Admin is looking over all recently unnapproved changes to
comments. Adam sees that George Genius has made a correction to the
earthquake prediction formula in which he helped write. He believes
that the their original formaula is correct, so Adam does not
approve of the changes. Several days later, George barges into
Adam's office wondering why his changes were not approved. After a
few hours George convinces Adam that the new modifications were
correct, and so Adam approves George's comment.</p>
