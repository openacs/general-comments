    <para>General Comments is an application package that relies on the
      ACS Messaging package. Comments can be associated with any object
      in ACS 4.0, which gives you the benefits of the Permission System.
      Comments are stored as ACS Messages.</para>

    <para>When a user creates a comment, General Comments stores the
      comment as an ACS Message and associates the comment to the object
      commented on. The value set by the adminstrator on whether comments
      go live immediately or needs approval first is stored along with
      the comment during this phase. After this, the user is presented
      with a page that displays contents of the comment along with
      revision history, attachments, and links to perform actions on the
      comment such as adding attachments or editing the comment.</para>

    <para><phrase>A user adding a comment:</phrase></para>
    <para>Nurse Nancy is browsing through an ACS 4.0 site that has a page for
      medical emergencies. Upon reaching the bottom of the page, Nancy
      sees a posting that reads, "<emphasis>Please help, my child has just
      swallowed some cleaning solution!!!</emphasis>". Nancy sees that this
      posting was made only 30 seconds ago and quickly posts a remedy for
      this situation. After she makes her posting, she immediately
      revisits the page and happily sees that her posting is already
      available.</para>

    <para><phrase>A user editing an old comment:</phrase></para>
    <para>George Genius is reviewing all of the comments he has posted over
      the last 24 hours. In one of his postings, George notices that his
      mathematical formula for earthquake prediction was incorrect. He
      then clicks on the edit link, makes changes to his formula and
      submits his changes. Since comments are moderated, others will only
      see his older incorrect version until his changes are approved.
      George eagerly awaits for his changes to be approved so that he
      won't be ridiculed by his colleagues for his mistakes.</para>

    <para><phrase>An adminstrator moderating:</phrase></para>
    <para>Adam Admin is looking over all recently unnapproved changes to
      comments. Adam sees that George Genius has made a correction to the
      earthquake prediction formula in which he helped write. He believes
      that the their original formaula is correct, so Adam does not
      approve of the changes. Several days later, George barges into
      Adam's office wondering why his changes were not approved. After a
      few hours George convinces Adam that the new modifications were
      correct, and so Adam approves George's comment.
